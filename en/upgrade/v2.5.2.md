# Upgrade to v2.5.2

## Friends links folder change

This version fixed the friends folder and the config name consistency issue. If you already started using friends link, your current friends page folder name would be `friends`.

All you have to do is change that folder name to `links`.

```shell
.
└── source
    └── friends // [!code --]
    └── links // [!code ++]
        └── index.md
```
